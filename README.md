# Automated RNA extraction for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics
Implemented by Raik Grünberg, Francisco Javier Guzmán & Gerardo Ramos-Mandujano

The automation script is based on in-house produced magnetic beads. Patient samples are provided in Trizol and are thus completely inactivated -- this makes the workflow save for a regular biosafety level 1 environment.
